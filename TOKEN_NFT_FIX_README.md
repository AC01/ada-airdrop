# ü™ô Token/NFT Fix for Transaction Builder

## Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Your UTXO contains tokens/NFTs, but the transaction builder was only handling ADA change, causing the transaction to be rejected because tokens would be "burned" (lost).

**Solution**: Updated the transaction builders to properly handle **both ADA and tokens/NFTs** in change outputs.

## What Changed

### Before (‚ùå Broken)
```python
# Only handled ADA change
change_output = TransactionOutput(
    address=sender_addr,
    amount=Value(coin=change_amount)  # Missing tokens!
)
```

### After (‚úÖ Fixed)
```python
# Collects ALL tokens/NFTs from selected UTXOs
total_tokens = {}
for utxo in selected_utxos:
    if utxo.output.amount.multi_asset:
        # Collect tokens...

# Creates change output with ADA + tokens/NFTs
change_value = Value(coin=change_amount, multi_asset=multi_asset)
change_output = TransactionOutput(
    address=sender_addr,
    amount=change_value  # Includes ALL assets!
)
```

## Updated Files

1. **`frontend/app.py`** - Streamlit app with token/NFT support
2. **`airdrop-transaction-builder/final_clean_transaction.py`** - CLI script with token/NFT support
3. **`test_tokens.py`** - New utility to inspect wallet tokens

## How to Use

### Option 1: Streamlit Frontend (Recommended)

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

The updated frontend will:
- ‚úÖ Automatically detect tokens/NFTs in your UTXOs
- ‚úÖ Include them in the change output
- ‚úÖ Show you what tokens were found
- ‚úÖ Generate valid transactions

### Option 2: CLI Script

```bash
cd airdrop-transaction-builder
python3 final_clean_transaction.py
```

### Option 3: Inspect Tokens First

Before generating transactions, you can inspect what tokens/NFTs are in your wallet:

```bash
python3 test_tokens.py
```

This will show you:
- All UTXOs in your wallet
- ADA amounts
- All tokens/NFTs with their quantities
- Policy IDs and asset names

## Example Output

When the script finds tokens, you'll see:

```
‚úÖ Added change output: 51.027960 ADA + 3 token types
ü™ô Tokens/NFTs in Change Output
Found 5 token(s)/NFT(s) that will be returned to your wallet
```

## Technical Details

### What the Fix Does

1. **Scans all selected UTXOs** for `multi_asset` content
2. **Aggregates tokens** by policy ID and asset name
3. **Creates MultiAsset object** containing all tokens
4. **Builds change output** with both ADA and tokens
5. **Prevents token burning** by preserving all assets

### Token Detection Logic

```python
# Collect all tokens/NFTs from selected UTXOs
total_tokens = {}
for utxo in selected_utxos:
    if utxo.output.amount.multi_asset:
        for policy_id, assets in utxo.output.amount.multi_asset.items():
            for asset_name, quantity in assets.items():
                # Aggregate quantities
                total_tokens[policy_id][asset_name] += quantity
```

## Why This Was Needed

Cardano transactions must **explicitly account for all assets**. If you spend a UTXO containing tokens/NFTs, those assets must either be:

1. **Sent to recipients** (in their outputs)
2. **Returned to you** (in change output)
3. **Explicitly burned** (rarely intended)

Since your airdrop only sends ADA to recipients, all tokens/NFTs must be returned to you via the change output.

## Validation

The updated scripts will show you:
- Number of tokens found
- Policy IDs and asset names
- Quantities of each token
- That they're included in change output

This ensures no tokens are accidentally lost during the airdrop transaction.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the token inspector** to see what's in your wallet
2. **Use the updated Streamlit app** to generate your transaction
3. **Verify the token info** in the transaction details
4. **Import into Eternl** and check that change output includes your tokens
5. **Submit the transaction** with confidence

The transaction should now be accepted by Eternl since it properly handles all assets in your UTXO! üéâ
